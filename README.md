# asp8_TowerDefense
A Tower Defense game for Agile Software Programming Group 8

## Developer Setup

Because of the nature of Phaser, and writing games with JavaScript, the game will need a web server to be able to be tested during development.  There are a few tools that can be used to help streamline this process.  Brackets and Visual Studio Code both have the ability to run a local web server for easy testing of the game.

### Brackets

Brackets can be used for development.  It is a great cross platform IDE and it has Live Preview built in by default.  It can be downloaded [here](https://brackets.io/).

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an excellent, cross platform IDE which has many extensions which can help with development.  It does not have a Live Preview feature built in, but does have the ability to add one through the use of Extensions.  VSCode can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and is regularly updated.  For easy development, I recommend installing a few extensions.

1. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - This extension will add the ability to right click an HTML file in the project and launch the live server.  This will run the server in the background and allow for easy testing in the Browser.
2. [Debugger For Chrome](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/23/introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code) - This will add a full debugger which will allow you to easily debug your code while it is running inside of Chrome.
